1- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Engineers should employ an environment that recommends secure patterns and promotes security standards through alerts in the environment to guarantee that code, program, or software is effective and secure. They ought to choose a programming language and framework depending on the requirements of the project and their firm. To ensure functioning, developers must first grasp the strengths and limitations of their selected language in order to comprehend the issues. Lastly, developers ought to streamline their processes to make it easy to implement security best practices. The idea is to encourage developers to patch issues during the normal flow of development instead of performing security scans at the end.

2- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Customer requirements are those that offer value to a product, service, or setting for the user. In order to incorporate user demands into an application, we must first go through a process in which users understand their issues, procedures, goals, and interests. Examples include functions, which are the tasks that a user must do. Functionality informs developers about what to create and implement. Following that, the user needs should be gathered from users with various qualities and abilities. Finally, features are related to functions since they specify how functions are implemented. Additions aren't required, yet they are a technique for meeting demands. 

3- How do I approach designing software?

When it comes to software design, there are two ways. The first is a bottom-up method, in which the design begins with the most fundamental parts and subsystems. These parts are used to generate or compose the following higher-level components and subsystems. This strategy can be utilized with the top-down strategy to hide low-level details regarding implementation. Following that is the top-down method, in which each system is separated into multiple subsystems and components. Each part of the system is further subdivided into a number of subsystems and elements. This division procedure aids in the formation of a system hierarchy framework. The fundamental advantage of the top-down method is that its significant emphasis on requirements aids in making a design flexible to its needs.
